            <h1>Writing your project proposal</h1>
            <p>This quick map proposal is due on September 29. The document has to be breif and the project plan to be finished in the last week of the session. Thus, it is a small project in which you need to design and implement an interactive map using ESRI API (Module 4). This map will be used to highlight key issues that plague our elections every year. I will be exploring what effect levels of poverty and diversity have on a district's voting turnout on election day. I will put layers on to show all of these and see where the highest levels of poverty overlap with the lowest levels of voter turnout to try to find solutions for districts like those all over the United States. The data will come from the Census Bureau and election poll results. It should be easily accessible to everyone with simple data presentation and interactivity.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><i class="heading">Describing the purpose of the map.</i> I will be exploring the differences in income and race and how those affect the voter turnout of a certain voting district in an effort to determine if there is a need for election day to be a national or state level holiday. This information would be ideally aimed at state or national congress people. I’m hoping that people would be able to explore the differences that income has on people’s willingness to go out and do their civic duties.</li>
                <li><i class="heading">The structure of the map.</i> I would most likely use a type of proportional symbol map in an effort to show the contrast between the income, diversity, and voting percentage. In order to provide more data to the viewer I would use a pop up window when they either scroll over or click on a district. In this window there would be specifics of income level, population diversity, and what percentage of that district's population is a registered voter or actually voted.</li>
                <li><i class="heading">The third paragraphs explains data sources:</i> Lots of data for this map (Ohio voting districts, population, income, and diversity) will be available from various government websites, either the Ohio Secretary of State of the US Census Beuru. Whereas the voting numbers are available from is available at ballotpedia and electionproject, two websites that cover voting numbers across the US.</li>
                <li><i class="heading">Methodology.</i> I will need to take the voter registration and combine it with the actual voter turnout numbers to figure out how many people in a district are showing up not out of those registered but out of those living in the district. From there I would have to figure out the best way to show the district's income levels and make it comparable across the state. Combining that with the diversity would show the correlation between minorities and income levels. Then I could put the two together and hopefully show a correlation between income/diversity and voting.</li>
                <li><i class="heading">Timeframe.</i> For the data collection it should take about 4 weeks to find the best information possible in a way that I can modify to fit the end map. During that time I will begin to process and modify the data I do have to be able to add it to the map. After 3 weeks I would be able to start coming up with ways that could incorporate all of the data into an intelligent map and how the people viewing can interact to learn more. Finally, the second half of the time frame would be dedicated to actually creating the map.</li>
